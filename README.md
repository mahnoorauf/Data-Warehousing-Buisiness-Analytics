üèóÔ∏èData Warehousing Labs

This repository contains all my hands-on lab exercises for the Data Warehousing course. These labs help me apply theory into practice, covering topics like ETL, ELT, dimensional modeling, star & snowflake schemas, analytic SQL, OLAP, data quality checks, performance optimization, and BI dashboards.

Throughout the course, I work with tools like Python, PostgreSQL, DuckDB, Power BI, AWS, Azure Synapse, Great Expectations, dbdiagram.io, Draw.io, and PySpark, building practical skills in designing, transforming, and analyzing data.

The labs start with foundational exercises such as comparing DW vs OLTP and running analytic SQL queries, then progress to cloud platforms, schema design, ETL pipelines, and data quality, and finally culminate in a capstone project where I build a mini data warehouse with a full BI dashboard.

This repository is a step-by-step record of my learning journey, showing how each lab builds on the previous one and demonstrating my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights.
